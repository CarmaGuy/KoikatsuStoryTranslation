# Koikatsu! Image Translation
This is an English-language translation of the Illusion eroge [Koikatu](http://illusion.jp/preview/koikatu/). This project only translates images. For text check [bbepis/KoikatsuTranslation](https://github.com/bbepis/KoikatsuTranslation) and [DeathWeasel1337/Koikatsu-Translations](https://github.com/DeathWeasel1337/Koikatsu-Translations).

This plugin uses [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) and [BepisPlugins for Koikatsu](https://github.com/bbepis/BepisPlugins) to translate images in the game without modifying any game files,

## How to install
1. Install the latest [AutoTranslator](https://github.com/bbepis/XUnity.AutoTranslator/releases).
2. Download the latest release from the [releases](https://github.com/IllusionMods/KoikatsuImageTranslation/releases) page.
3. Extract the archive into your game directory.
4. If you have Koikatsu Party (not Koikatu) remove `\BepInEx\Translation\en\Texture\Koikatu.zip` to prevent translation collisions.

## Contributing
When you have translations to submit [fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/). Upload your changes to your fork and then [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). Your pull request will be reviewed and accepted after a quality check. Again, no raw machine translations will be accepted. Proper capitalization, punctuation, and spelling is a must.  

Coordinate with other translators on the [Koikatsu Discord](https://discord.gg/urDt8CK) lingual-studies channel.
