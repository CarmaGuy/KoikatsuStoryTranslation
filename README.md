# KoikatsuTranslation

This is an English-language translation of the Illusion eroge [Koikatsu.](http://illusion.jp/preview/koikatu/) This project only translates images. For text check [bbepis/KoikatsuTranslation](https://github.com/bbepis/KoikatsuTranslation) and [Koikatsu-Translations](https://github.com/DeathWeasel1337/Koikatsu-Translations).

This plugin uses [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) and [BepisPlugins for Koikatsu](https://github.com/bbepis/BepisPlugins) to translate images in the game without modifying any game files,

## Installation
These translations require the latest build of BepisPlugins since they rely on changes made to DynamicTranslationLoader not yet available in the current BepisPlugins release.

1. Install the [latest BepisPlugins build](http://bepisbuilds.dyn.mk/bepis_plugins)  
2. Press the green "Clone or download" button above and click "download zip"  
3. Extract the zip and merge the `\BepInEx\Translation` folder with the one in your `\BepInEx` folder.  

## Contributing
When you have translations to submit [fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/). Upload your changes to your fork and then [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). Your pull request will be reviewed and accepted after a quality check. Again, no raw machine translations will be accepted. Proper capitalization, punctuation, and spelling is a must.
