# Koikatsu! Image Translation
This is an English-language translation of the Illusion eroge [Koikatu](http://illusion.jp/preview/koikatu/). This project only translates images. For text check [bbepis/KoikatsuTranslation](https://github.com/bbepis/KoikatsuTranslation) and [DeathWeasel1337/Koikatsu-Translations](https://github.com/DeathWeasel1337/Koikatsu-Translations).

This plugin uses [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) and [BepisPlugins for Koikatsu](https://github.com/bbepis/BepisPlugins) to translate images in the game without modifying any game files,

When you have translations to submit [fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/). Upload your changes to your fork and then [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). Your pull request will be reviewed and accepted after a quality check.
