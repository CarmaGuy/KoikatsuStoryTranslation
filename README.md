# KoikatsuTranslation (Darkpulse-tl)

This is Dark Pulse's translation branch for the KoikatsuTranslation project.

Inside you'll find possibly more up-to-date translations than are on the Master branch. However, there is a chance that these might take advantage of new features in BepInEx, and so aren't always guaranteed to work.

If there are problems, either update to a Bleeding Edge build of BepInEx/BepisPlugins, or stick with the official releases on Master until the contents of this branch (and possibly others) get merged into Master.
